  <p class="exp mt-3">
<b>Paleolithic Era (Old Stone Age)</b><br>

Timeframe: Approximately 2.5 million years ago to 10,000 BCE.<br>
Key Characteristics: Nomadic hunter-gatherer societies, use of simple stone tools, development of basic art such as cave paintings (e.g., Lascaux in France).<br><br>
<b>Mesolithic Era (Middle Stone Age)</b><br>

Timeframe: Circa 10,000 BCE to 6,000 BCE.<br>
Key Characteristics: Transition period featuring more advanced tool use, domestication of dogs, beginnings of semi-permanent settlements.<br><br>
<b>Neolithic Era (New Stone Age)</b><br>

Timeframe: Circa 6,000 BCE to 3,000 BCE.<br>
Key Characteristics: Agricultural revolution, domestication of plants and animals, development of pottery, weaving, and permanent settlements.<br><br>
<b>Early Civilizations</b><br><br>
<b>Mesopotamia</b><br>

<b>Pre-Sumerian Cultures:</b> Ubaid (circa 6500-3800 BCE) – development of irrigation, early temple structures, and communal living.<br>
<b>Proto-writing systems:</b> Development of cuneiform writing in late Ubaid and Uruk periods.<br><br>
<b>Ancient Egypt</b><br>

<b>Pre-Dynastic Egypt (circa 6000-3150 BCE):</b> Development of small farming communities along the Nile, advancements in pottery, and rudimentary forms of writing.<br>
Key Cultures: Badarian, Naqada I, II, and III cultures contributing to the formation of the first Egyptian dynasties.
<b>Indus Valley (Harappan Civilization)</b><br>

Timeframe: Early stages around 7000 BCE with major urban developments by 3300 BCE.<br>
Key Sites: Mehrgarh (one of the earliest farming settlements), Harappa, Mohenjo-Daro – known for advanced urban planning, drainage systems, and trade.<br><br>
<b>China</b><br><br>

Neolithic Cultures: Jiahu (circa 7000-5800 BCE) – early examples of proto-writing, music (flutes), and agriculture.<br>
Yangshao Culture (circa 5000-3000 BCE): Known for painted pottery, village settlements, and early silk production.<br>
Longshan Culture (circa 3000-1900 BCE): Characterized by black pottery, walled settlements, and increased social complexity.<br><br>
<b>Europe</b><br><br>

Neolithic Cultures: Varied across the continent with notable examples such as the Linear Pottery Culture (circa 5500-4500 BCE) in Central Europe and the Megalithic structures in Western Europe (e.g., Stonehenge, circa 3000-2000 BCE).<br>
Key Developments: Agriculture spread from the Near East, leading to permanent settlements and complex societies.<br><br>
<b>The Americas</b><br><br>

Early Cultures: Clovis culture (circa 13,000 BCE) – characterized by distinctive stone tools, followed by various regional developments such as the pre-Olmec cultures in Mesoamerica (circa 2500 BCE) which laid foundations for later civilizations.<br><br>
<b>Africa</b><br>

Neolithic Cultures: Diverse developments with significant advancements in the Nile Valley, such as Nabta Playa (circa 7500-3500 BCE) – a ceremonial complex predating the Egyptian pyramids.<br>
Saharan Cultures: Before desertification, the Sahara hosted complex societies that practiced agriculture and animal husbandry.<br><br>

<b>Key Innovations and Developments</b><br><br>
<img class="img-wrap img-fluid img-right" src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th/id/OIG3.4nRMc1ZrEB6PalKKt3uz?pid=ImgGn"><br>
Agriculture: The domestication of plants (e.g., wheat, barley, rice, maize) and animals (e.g., sheep, cattle) revolutionized human societies, allowing for surplus food production and population growth.<br>
Metallurgy: The use of metals like copper and bronze began towards the end of the Neolithic, marking the transition to the Bronze Age.<br>
Writing Systems: Early forms of writing emerged in Mesopotamia (cuneiform) and Egypt (hieroglyphs), facilitating record-keeping, administration, and cultural expression.<br>
This summary provides a glimpse into the rich and diverse tapestry of human history before the establishment of the Sumerian civilization.<br>Each region experienced unique developments that contributed to the complexity of early human societies.
